# Schedules

Schedules is a web app that is written with Ruby on Rails and allows students build, share, and export their Schedules. It includes a powerful search engine which lets students get information about both courses and professors at GMU.

The project manager for Schedules is Zac Wood.

## Contributing

Schedules is currently in version 4 and is a somewhat mature web application. However, there are always new features that can be added and old bugs that need fixing, so all help is much appreciated. See the current project [issues](https://git.gmu.edu/srct/schedules/issues) to see what needs to get done, or submit an issue of your own if you have a feature request or found a bug.

If you need any help, please feel free to reach out in the `#schedules` channel in our [Slack group](https://srct.slack.com/). This is where most of the discussion about the project occurs, so if you are interesting in contributing, please join and say hi!

### Learning Ruby on Rails

Rails is a web framework written in Ruby that makes developing web applications fun and productive. However, it does have quite a steep learning curve. Before you contribute to Schedules, it's worth learning the basics of Rails first. This will give you the ability to understand and navigate through the project structure before trying to make your contribution.
Thankfully, there are tons of great free online resources to learn Rails. Here are a few that we recommend to newcomers:
- [Official Getting Started with Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html)
- [Derek Banas' Ruby on Rails Tutorial (30min)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GY7Ps8fqGdc)
- [Rails Tutorial (free online ebook)](https://www.railstutorial.org/book)
